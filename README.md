# algorithms-and-data-structures

In this repository i will mainly put all of my third semester projects from Algorithms and Data Structures course at AGH University of Science and Technology however i will add content which is off the course.

All projects are written in **C++** programming language.

Here is little overview of topics which were covered during the course, here is the [syllabus](https://syllabuskrk.agh.edu.pl/2018-2019/pl/magnesite/study_plans/stacjonarne-informatyka-stosowana--5/module/mis-1-303-s-algorytmy-i-struktury-danych?archive=03032014).

### Data Structures:

  * **Stacks**
  * **Queues**
  * **Trees**
  * **Graphs**
  
### Algorithms:

  * **Kurskal's MST**
  * **Bubble sort (multiple variants)**
  * **Selection sort**
  * **Insertion sort**
  * **Merge sort**
  * **Qucik sort**
  * **Heap sort**
  * **Comb sort**
  * **Shell sort**
  * **Radix sort**
  * **BFS Graph Traversal**
  * **DFS Graph Traversal**
  * **Pre-order tree traversal**
  * **In-order tree traversal**
  * **Post-order tree traversal**
